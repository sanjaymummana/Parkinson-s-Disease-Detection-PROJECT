# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-PROJECT  
Parkinson's disease detection using Data Analytics method along with python language.  
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle. Dataset has a shape of (195*24).  
Follow the below steps to complete the project:

2)Data Collection & Analysis  
a) loading the data from csv file to a Pandas DataFrame  
b) checking for missing values in each column  
c) grouping the data based on the target variable   
3)Data Pre-Processing  
4)Separating the features & Target  
5)Splitting the data to training data & Test data  
6)Data Standardization  
7)Model Training(SVM)
8)Model Evaluation  
9)Building a Predictive System  
10)After completion of the project, we get an accuracy of 81,7%.
